# Link

![Link](/app/public/assets/images/link.jpg)

## Technology

This app was built with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), & [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

## Concept

Link is a simple take on a dating app. Users input their name, add a photo, and answer a series of questions. Link matches the user against everyone else in the system and displays their new best friend.

## Motivation

This app is an exercies in taking in user data, comparing it against existing data, and finding the closest match. I wanted this app to be clean and functional while having some stronger design elements. I wanted to avoid using a CSS library like Bootstrap to push my own styling skills, and I used this project to start learning the Sass CSS pre-processor.

## Design Process

To make the app feel more like a real product, I created a simple landing page that lets visitors know what Link is about. On the next page, I didn't want the user to see a simple form so I worked on a way to only display one queestion at a time. There is an expanding underline effect when each question is active to focus the user's attention, and the modal that pops up at the end was coded by hand.

## Known Issues

- Tabbing through the form fields works, but users are still required to click through using the `Next` button in order to submit the form.
- Please report as you find more.
