# Link
An app to find new friends

## How it works
The user enters their name and link to a photo, then answers a series of questions. The user's answers are checked against all other users' answers and the most compatible match is displayed for the user.

## Known Issues
* Tabbing through the form fields works, but users are still required to click through using the `Next` button in order to submit the form.
* Please report as you find more.
